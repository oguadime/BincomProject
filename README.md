# Shirt Color Statistical Analysis 
This repository contains a Python implementation of various statistical calculations and algorithms applied to the occurrences of shirt colors worn throughout the week. 
The program calculates mean, mode, median, variance, and probability while also including a search algorithm and random number conversion.

# Description 
The script performs the following tasks: 
- Mean: Calculates the average number of times each shirt color was worn.
- Mode: Identifies the most frequently worn color.
- Median: Finds the median of the occurrences of shirt colors.
- Variance: Computes the variance, measuring the spread of occurrences.
- Probability: Calculates the probability of picking a specific color at random.
- Recursive Search Algorithm: Searches for a key element in a list using a linear search.
- Random Number Conversion: Generates a random binary number and converts it to decimal.

# Key Features 
- Statistical Functions: Includes functions for mean, mode, median, variance, and probability.
- Search Algorithm: A recursive search implementation.
- Random Number Generation: Demonstrates binary-to-decimal conversion of random numbers.

# Usage 
Syntax 
Each section is implemented as a function or a standalone block of code. Below is a summary of the key functions and their use:
- Mean
   ```matlab
   mean([list_of_occurrences])
   ```
- Mode
   ```matlab
   mode([list_of_occurrences])
   ```
- Median
   ```matlab
   median([list_of_occurrences])
   ```
- Variance
   ```matlab
   variance([list_of_occurrences])
   ```
- Probability of Picking Red
   ```matlab
  prob = red / total_occurrences
   ```
- Recursive Search Algorithm
  ```matlab
  search(list1, key)
   ```
- Random Number Conversion
  ```matlab
  random.random()
  ```
# Examples 
Example Input Data
